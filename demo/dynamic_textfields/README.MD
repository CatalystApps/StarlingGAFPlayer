☑ Basic

* Limit max bake scale = 1 is used to decrease texture atlas size. Purple background is baked in texture atlas in smaller size than it is used in animation. Upper scaling for it doesn't cause pixelation effect.

* Conversion mode "nesting" is used to save Dynamic TextFields in converted GAF asset.
