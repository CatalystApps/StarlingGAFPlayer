GAF Converter conversion settings:

☑ Compress *.Gaf
Conversion source: Main Timeline
Conversion mode: nesting

☑ Limit max bake scale = 1
Atlas max size: 2048x2048

☑ Basic

* Limit max bake scale = 1 is used to decrease texture atlas size. Purple background is baked in texture atlas in smaller size than it is used in animation. Upper scaling for it doesn't cause pixelation effect.

* Conversion mode "nesting" is used to save Dynamic TextFields in converted GAF asset.
